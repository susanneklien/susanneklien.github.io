## About myself
I am currently working for the Modern Japanese Studies Program at Hokkaido University where I am in charge of teaching Japanese culture and society to mostly international students from across the globe. Originally from Vienna, Austria, I have been an associate professor at Hokkaido University since September 2013.

## Research
I have a broad range of research interests in the modern culture and society of Japan, but I categorise them into three main areas (although there is some overlap between them).
1) Immaterial culture, i.e. the practice and transmission of tradition,
2) Subjective well-being and alternative modes of working and living in contemporary rural Japan 
3) Regional revitalization and tourism.
