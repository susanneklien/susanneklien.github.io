## Welcome to the homepage of Susanne Klien

## About myself
I am currently working for the Modern Japanese Studies Program at Hokkaido University where I am in charge of teaching Japanese culture and society to mostly international students from across the globe. Originally from Vienna, Austria, I have been an associate professor at Hokkaido University since September 2013.

## Research
I have a broad range of research interests in the modern culture and society of Japan, but I categorise them into the following main themes (although there is some overlap between them).
1) Immaterial culture, i.e. the practice and transmission of tradition(s) such as festivals, dances and various rituals,
2) Subjective well-being and alternative modes of working and living in post-growth rural Japan (including new forms of entrepreneurship)
3) Mobility of Japanese individuals abroad for lifestyle reasons
4) Regional revitalization, rurality, locality and placemaking
5) Youth subcultures (ethnography of hip hop in Hokkaido)
